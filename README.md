CitiTradersRE (REvisited)
=========================

First off, some notes to previous users...

This plugin no longer is going to depend on Citizens API, why not? Not that I don't love citizens and have a great
respect for the authors, there are some limitations that I need to get around to make this a complete shop plugin
the likes that bukkit has never seen.

Goals
=====
ANY Item, Mob, NPC (even ones created with Citizens) can be a store. There will be no limits.
I am even looking into creating PORTALABLE stores (as in, stores attached to items in hand, right click to access)

1 Stores will be accessable by voice (chat) by name.
2 Stores will be clickable.
3 Stores will be configuable to cascade (Catagories -> Catagories -> Items)
4 ADMIN, USER, SERVER shops will be possible.
5 Items will have custom ToolTips to represent cost

Welcome to CITITRADERS Revisited, this will be the best most flexable store plugin ever created ;) Welcome home.
